      "In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù but also ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù and ‚Äùa prime example of this administration‚Äôs ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.‚Äù Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ‚Äù[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia‚Äôs worldwide aggression, including its   operations,‚Äù wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ‚ÄùNow with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.‚Äù Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ‚Äùmuch tougher‚Äù actions and said three times that Obama had ‚Äùfinally found his tongue.‚Äù Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama‚Äôs real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ‚Äùtie Trump‚Äôs hands‚Äù or ‚Äùbox him in,‚Äù meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country‚Äôs embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad‚Äôs forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ‚Äùfind‚Äù missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  ‚Äî   Putin‚Äôs longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump‚Äôs extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  ‚Äî   the idea that they helped Trump win  ‚Äî   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump‚Äôs legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies‚Äô concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ‚Äùno one really knows what happened.‚Äù He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ‚Äùget on with our lives and do more important things.‚Äù However, at week‚Äôs end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  ‚Äî   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia‚Äôs hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister‚Äôs recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ‚Äùthe bigger man,‚Äù even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ‚ÄùGreat move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!‚Äù At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.\n",

      "  Donald Trump has used Twitter  ‚Äî   his preferred means of communication  ‚Äî   to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters  ‚Äî   but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won‚Äôt end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.‚Äôs abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the   solution in the region. Trump‚Äôs support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  ‚Äî   who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama  ‚Äî   may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump‚Äôs morning tweets, thanking him  ‚Äî   and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers  ‚Äî   for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ‚Äùdetailed, sensitive information‚Äù proving that the U. S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U. S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ‚Äùthings will be different‚Äù come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U. N. as ineffective. The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe reported that the   told them he wanted an ‚Äùarms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.‚Äù As the Washington Post‚Äôs Dan Zak told NPR‚Äôs Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ‚ÄùTrump said, you know, he‚Äôd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they‚Äôre capable of doing,‚Äù Zak said. ‚ÄùAt the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy.‚Äù Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ‚Äùunpresidented‚Äù in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. It‚Äôs not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn‚Äôt recognize it, and most other countries don‚Äôt either. The U. S. has operated under a ‚Äùone China‚Äù policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U. S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U. S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka‚Äôs clothing and shoe lines are made in China much of Trump‚Äôs own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China.\n",

      "  Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin‚Äôs decision not to expel U. S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country  ‚Äî   admiring the Russian leader‚Äôs strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump‚Äôs ongoing praise of Putin. Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise  ‚Äî   a stark break from decades of U. S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U. S. also retweeted Trump‚Äôs post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U. S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said ‚Äùall Americans should be alarmed by Russia‚Äôs actions.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama‚Äôs actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù but ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù and said that ‚ÄùRussia does not share America‚Äôs interests.‚Äù ‚ÄùThe Russians are not our friends,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ‚Äùgood initial step.‚Äù Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U. S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia‚Äôs economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.‚Äù He said he would meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ‚ÄùHe‚Äôs running his country, and at least he‚Äôs a leader, unlike what we have in this country,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ‚Äùtalented.‚Äù Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ‚ÄùI never met Putin. I don‚Äôt know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I‚Äôm a genius. I said, ‚ÄôThank you very much‚Äô to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,‚Äù Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn‚Äôt going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ‚Äùa leader far more than our president has been‚Äù at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump‚Äôs debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ‚Äùpuppet‚Äù of Russia. Trump shot back: ‚ÄùNo puppet. No puppet. You‚Äôre the puppet.‚Äù He often criticizes the   ‚Äùreset‚Äù with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy  ‚Äî   violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump‚Äôs staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won‚Äôt end once he‚Äôs in the Oval Office. So far, he‚Äôs outlined his opposition to the United States‚Äô abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he‚Äôs often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia  ‚Äî   perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama‚Äôs.\n",

      "Updated at 2:50 p. m. ET, Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia won‚Äôt be expelling U. S. diplomats in a    response to U. S. sanctions, as his foreign minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of   Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Trump took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to praise Putin‚Äôs decision, calling it a ‚Äùgreat move.‚Äù On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it called ‚Äùa   campaign of   operations‚Äù against the U. S.  ‚Äî   including actions meant to interfere with the U. S. presidential election. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went on state TV and called the sanctions ‚Äùantics‚Äù that Russia can‚Äôt leave unanswered. He said the U. S. provided no evidence for its claims of Russian cyber operations, NPR‚Äôs Lucian Kim reports. ‚ÄùThe Kremlin has consistently denied accusations that its hackers had broken into the Democratic National Committee or tried to sway the U. S. election,‚Äù Lucian notes. And he proposed specific counteractions Russia could take. As we reported Thursday, President Obama‚Äôs executive order calls for 35 Russian diplomats  ‚Äî   described by the White House as ‚Äùintelligence operatives‚Äù  ‚Äî   to be expelled from the U. S. and for two Russian facilities in the U. S. to be closed. Sanctions will also be imposed on several Russian individuals and organizations, and Obama‚Äôs statement says more actions will be taken, ‚Äùsome of which will not be publicized.‚Äù Lavrov announced plans for Russia to respond in kind, as Lucian reported from Moscow. Lavrov‚Äôs plan, which needed Putin‚Äôs approval, called for 35 American diplomats to be expelled and for U. S. diplomats to ‚Äùlose access to two buildings, just as Russian diplomats will no longer be able to use two retreats in Maryland and New York,‚Äù Lucian reports. But just two hours after Lavrov‚Äôs comments, Putin announced that nothing of the sort was happening. Putin called the Obama administration‚Äôs actions provocative and said Russia had grounds for a response. He said the Kremlin would reserve the right to a countermeasure  ‚Äî   but that it would not ‚Äùstoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy,‚Äù as Lucian translated it. At least for now, no diplomats will be expelled or barred from using facilities in Moscow, he said. Any actions will wait until Trump takes office. ‚ÄùIt is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,‚Äù Putin said. ‚ÄùNevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. ‚ÄùMy season‚Äôs greetings also to   Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.‚Äù\n",

      "In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù but also ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù and ‚Äùa prime example of this administration‚Äôs ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.‚Äù Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ‚Äù[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia‚Äôs worldwide aggression, including its   operations,‚Äù wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ‚ÄùNow with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.‚Äù Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ‚Äùmuch tougher‚Äù actions and said three times that Obama had ‚Äùfinally found his tongue.‚Äù Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama‚Äôs real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ‚Äùtie Trump‚Äôs hands‚Äù or ‚Äùbox him in,‚Äù meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country‚Äôs embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad‚Äôs forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ‚Äùfind‚Äù missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  ‚Äî   Putin‚Äôs longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump‚Äôs extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  ‚Äî   the idea that they helped Trump win  ‚Äî   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump‚Äôs legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies‚Äô concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ‚Äùno one really knows what happened.‚Äù He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ‚Äùget on with our lives and do more important things.‚Äù However, at week‚Äôs end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  ‚Äî   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia‚Äôs hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister‚Äôs recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ‚Äùthe bigger man,‚Äù even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ‚ÄùGreat move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!‚Äù At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.\n",

      "  Donald Trump has used Twitter  ‚Äî   his preferred means of communication  ‚Äî   to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters  ‚Äî   but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won‚Äôt end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.‚Äôs abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the   solution in the region. Trump‚Äôs support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  ‚Äî   who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama  ‚Äî   may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump‚Äôs morning tweets, thanking him  ‚Äî   and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers  ‚Äî   for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ‚Äùdetailed, sensitive information‚Äù proving that the U. S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U. S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ‚Äùthings will be different‚Äù come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U. N. as ineffective. The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe reported that the   told them he wanted an ‚Äùarms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.‚Äù As the Washington Post‚Äôs Dan Zak told NPR‚Äôs Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ‚ÄùTrump said, you know, he‚Äôd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they‚Äôre capable of doing,‚Äù Zak said. ‚ÄùAt the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy.‚Äù Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ‚Äùunpresidented‚Äù in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. It‚Äôs not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn‚Äôt recognize it, and most other countries don‚Äôt either. The U. S. has operated under a ‚Äùone China‚Äù policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U. S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U. S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka‚Äôs clothing and shoe lines are made in China much of Trump‚Äôs own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China.\n",

      "  Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin‚Äôs decision not to expel U. S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country  ‚Äî   admiring the Russian leader‚Äôs strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump‚Äôs ongoing praise of Putin. Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise  ‚Äî   a stark break from decades of U. S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U. S. also retweeted Trump‚Äôs post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U. S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said ‚Äùall Americans should be alarmed by Russia‚Äôs actions.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama‚Äôs actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù but ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù and said that ‚ÄùRussia does not share America‚Äôs interests.‚Äù ‚ÄùThe Russians are not our friends,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ‚Äùgood initial step.‚Äù Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U. S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia‚Äôs economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.‚Äù He said he would meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ‚ÄùHe‚Äôs running his country, and at least he‚Äôs a leader, unlike what we have in this country,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ‚Äùtalented.‚Äù Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ‚ÄùI never met Putin. I don‚Äôt know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I‚Äôm a genius. I said, ‚ÄôThank you very much‚Äô to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,‚Äù Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn‚Äôt going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ‚Äùa leader far more than our president has been‚Äù at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump‚Äôs debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ‚Äùpuppet‚Äù of Russia. Trump shot back: ‚ÄùNo puppet. No puppet. You‚Äôre the puppet.‚Äù He often criticizes the   ‚Äùreset‚Äù with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy  ‚Äî   violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump‚Äôs staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won‚Äôt end once he‚Äôs in the Oval Office. So far, he‚Äôs outlined his opposition to the United States‚Äô abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he‚Äôs often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia  ‚Äî   perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama‚Äôs.\n",

      "Updated at 2:50 p. m. ET, Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia won‚Äôt be expelling U. S. diplomats in a    response to U. S. sanctions, as his foreign minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of   Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Trump took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to praise Putin‚Äôs decision, calling it a ‚Äùgreat move.‚Äù On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it called ‚Äùa   campaign of   operations‚Äù against the U. S.  ‚Äî   including actions meant to interfere with the U. S. presidential election. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went on state TV and called the sanctions ‚Äùantics‚Äù that Russia can‚Äôt leave unanswered. He said the U. S. provided no evidence for its claims of Russian cyber operations, NPR‚Äôs Lucian Kim reports. ‚ÄùThe Kremlin has consistently denied accusations that its hackers had broken into the Democratic National Committee or tried to sway the U. S. election,‚Äù Lucian notes. And he proposed specific counteractions Russia could take. As we reported Thursday, President Obama‚Äôs executive order calls for 35 Russian diplomats  ‚Äî   described by the White House as ‚Äùintelligence operatives‚Äù  ‚Äî   to be expelled from the U. S. and for two Russian facilities in the U. S. to be closed. Sanctions will also be imposed on several Russian individuals and organizations, and Obama‚Äôs statement says more actions will be taken, ‚Äùsome of which will not be publicized.‚Äù Lavrov announced plans for Russia to respond in kind, as Lucian reported from Moscow. Lavrov‚Äôs plan, which needed Putin‚Äôs approval, called for 35 American diplomats to be expelled and for U. S. diplomats to ‚Äùlose access to two buildings, just as Russian diplomats will no longer be able to use two retreats in Maryland and New York,‚Äù Lucian reports. But just two hours after Lavrov‚Äôs comments, Putin announced that nothing of the sort was happening. Putin called the Obama administration‚Äôs actions provocative and said Russia had grounds for a response. He said the Kremlin would reserve the right to a countermeasure  ‚Äî   but that it would not ‚Äùstoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy,‚Äù as Lucian translated it. At least for now, no diplomats will be expelled or barred from using facilities in Moscow, he said. Any actions will wait until Trump takes office. ‚ÄùIt is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,‚Äù Putin said. ‚ÄùNevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. ‚ÄùMy season‚Äôs greetings also to   Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.‚Äù\n",

      "In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù but also ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù and ‚Äùa prime example of this administration‚Äôs ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.‚Äù Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ‚Äù[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia‚Äôs worldwide aggression, including its   operations,‚Äù wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ‚ÄùNow with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.‚Äù Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ‚Äùmuch tougher‚Äù actions and said three times that Obama had ‚Äùfinally found his tongue.‚Äù Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama‚Äôs real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ‚Äùtie Trump‚Äôs hands‚Äù or ‚Äùbox him in,‚Äù meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country‚Äôs embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad‚Äôs forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ‚Äùfind‚Äù missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  ‚Äî   Putin‚Äôs longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump‚Äôs extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  ‚Äî   the idea that they helped Trump win  ‚Äî   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump‚Äôs legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies‚Äô concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ‚Äùno one really knows what happened.‚Äù He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ‚Äùget on with our lives and do more important things.‚Äù However, at week‚Äôs end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  ‚Äî   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia‚Äôs hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister‚Äôs recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ‚Äùthe bigger man,‚Äù even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ‚ÄùGreat move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!‚Äù At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.\n",

      "  Donald Trump has used Twitter  ‚Äî   his preferred means of communication  ‚Äî   to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters  ‚Äî   but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won‚Äôt end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.‚Äôs abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the   solution in the region. Trump‚Äôs support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  ‚Äî   who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama  ‚Äî   may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump‚Äôs morning tweets, thanking him  ‚Äî   and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers  ‚Äî   for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ‚Äùdetailed, sensitive information‚Äù proving that the U. S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U. S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ‚Äùthings will be different‚Äù come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U. N. as ineffective. The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe reported that the   told them he wanted an ‚Äùarms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.‚Äù As the Washington Post‚Äôs Dan Zak told NPR‚Äôs Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ‚ÄùTrump said, you know, he‚Äôd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they‚Äôre capable of doing,‚Äù Zak said. ‚ÄùAt the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy.‚Äù Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ‚Äùunpresidented‚Äù in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. It‚Äôs not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn‚Äôt recognize it, and most other countries don‚Äôt either. The U. S. has operated under a ‚Äùone China‚Äù policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U. S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U. S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka‚Äôs clothing and shoe lines are made in China much of Trump‚Äôs own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China.\n",

      "  Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin‚Äôs decision not to expel U. S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country  ‚Äî   admiring the Russian leader‚Äôs strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump‚Äôs ongoing praise of Putin. Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise  ‚Äî   a stark break from decades of U. S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U. S. also retweeted Trump‚Äôs post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U. S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said ‚Äùall Americans should be alarmed by Russia‚Äôs actions.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama‚Äôs actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù but ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù and said that ‚ÄùRussia does not share America‚Äôs interests.‚Äù ‚ÄùThe Russians are not our friends,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ‚Äùgood initial step.‚Äù Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U. S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia‚Äôs economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.‚Äù He said he would meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ‚ÄùHe‚Äôs running his country, and at least he‚Äôs a leader, unlike what we have in this country,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ‚Äùtalented.‚Äù Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ‚ÄùI never met Putin. I don‚Äôt know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I‚Äôm a genius. I said, ‚ÄôThank you very much‚Äô to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,‚Äù Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn‚Äôt going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ‚Äùa leader far more than our president has been‚Äù at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump‚Äôs debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ‚Äùpuppet‚Äù of Russia. Trump shot back: ‚ÄùNo puppet. No puppet. You‚Äôre the puppet.‚Äù He often criticizes the   ‚Äùreset‚Äù with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy  ‚Äî   violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump‚Äôs staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won‚Äôt end once he‚Äôs in the Oval Office. So far, he‚Äôs outlined his opposition to the United States‚Äô abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he‚Äôs often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia  ‚Äî   perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama‚Äôs.\n",

      "Updated at 2:50 p. m. ET, Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia won‚Äôt be expelling U. S. diplomats in a    response to U. S. sanctions, as his foreign minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of   Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Trump took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to praise Putin‚Äôs decision, calling it a ‚Äùgreat move.‚Äù On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it called ‚Äùa   campaign of   operations‚Äù against the U. S.  ‚Äî   including actions meant to interfere with the U. S. presidential election. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went on state TV and called the sanctions ‚Äùantics‚Äù that Russia can‚Äôt leave unanswered. He said the U. S. provided no evidence for its claims of Russian cyber operations, NPR‚Äôs Lucian Kim reports. ‚ÄùThe Kremlin has consistently denied accusations that its hackers had broken into the Democratic National Committee or tried to sway the U. S. election,‚Äù Lucian notes. And he proposed specific counteractions Russia could take. As we reported Thursday, President Obama‚Äôs executive order calls for 35 Russian diplomats  ‚Äî   described by the White House as ‚Äùintelligence operatives‚Äù  ‚Äî   to be expelled from the U. S. and for two Russian facilities in the U. S. to be closed. Sanctions will also be imposed on several Russian individuals and organizations, and Obama‚Äôs statement says more actions will be taken, ‚Äùsome of which will not be publicized.‚Äù Lavrov announced plans for Russia to respond in kind, as Lucian reported from Moscow. Lavrov‚Äôs plan, which needed Putin‚Äôs approval, called for 35 American diplomats to be expelled and for U. S. diplomats to ‚Äùlose access to two buildings, just as Russian diplomats will no longer be able to use two retreats in Maryland and New York,‚Äù Lucian reports. But just two hours after Lavrov‚Äôs comments, Putin announced that nothing of the sort was happening. Putin called the Obama administration‚Äôs actions provocative and said Russia had grounds for a response. He said the Kremlin would reserve the right to a countermeasure  ‚Äî   but that it would not ‚Äùstoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy,‚Äù as Lucian translated it. At least for now, no diplomats will be expelled or barred from using facilities in Moscow, he said. Any actions will wait until Trump takes office. ‚ÄùIt is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,‚Äù Putin said. ‚ÄùNevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. ‚ÄùMy season‚Äôs greetings also to   Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.‚Äù\n",

      "In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù but also ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù and ‚Äùa prime example of this administration‚Äôs ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.‚Äù Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ‚Äù[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia‚Äôs worldwide aggression, including its   operations,‚Äù wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ‚ÄùNow with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.‚Äù Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ‚Äùmuch tougher‚Äù actions and said three times that Obama had ‚Äùfinally found his tongue.‚Äù Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama‚Äôs real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ‚Äùtie Trump‚Äôs hands‚Äù or ‚Äùbox him in,‚Äù meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country‚Äôs embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad‚Äôs forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ‚Äùfind‚Äù missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  ‚Äî   Putin‚Äôs longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump‚Äôs extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  ‚Äî   the idea that they helped Trump win  ‚Äî   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump‚Äôs legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies‚Äô concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ‚Äùno one really knows what happened.‚Äù He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ‚Äùget on with our lives and do more important things.‚Äù However, at week‚Äôs end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  ‚Äî   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia‚Äôs hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister‚Äôs recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ‚Äùthe bigger man,‚Äù even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ‚ÄùGreat move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!‚Äù At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.\n",

      "  Donald Trump has used Twitter  ‚Äî   his preferred means of communication  ‚Äî   to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters  ‚Äî   but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won‚Äôt end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.‚Äôs abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the   solution in the region. Trump‚Äôs support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  ‚Äî   who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama  ‚Äî   may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump‚Äôs morning tweets, thanking him  ‚Äî   and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers  ‚Äî   for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ‚Äùdetailed, sensitive information‚Äù proving that the U. S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U. S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ‚Äùthings will be different‚Äù come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U. N. as ineffective. The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe reported that the   told them he wanted an ‚Äùarms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.‚Äù As the Washington Post‚Äôs Dan Zak told NPR‚Äôs Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ‚ÄùTrump said, you know, he‚Äôd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they‚Äôre capable of doing,‚Äù Zak said. ‚ÄùAt the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy.‚Äù Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ‚Äùunpresidented‚Äù in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. It‚Äôs not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn‚Äôt recognize it, and most other countries don‚Äôt either. The U. S. has operated under a ‚Äùone China‚Äù policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U. S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U. S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka‚Äôs clothing and shoe lines are made in China much of Trump‚Äôs own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China.\n",

      "  Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin‚Äôs decision not to expel U. S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country  ‚Äî   admiring the Russian leader‚Äôs strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump‚Äôs ongoing praise of Putin. Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise  ‚Äî   a stark break from decades of U. S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U. S. also retweeted Trump‚Äôs post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U. S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said ‚Äùall Americans should be alarmed by Russia‚Äôs actions.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama‚Äôs actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù but ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù and said that ‚ÄùRussia does not share America‚Äôs interests.‚Äù ‚ÄùThe Russians are not our friends,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ‚Äùgood initial step.‚Äù Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U. S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia‚Äôs economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.‚Äù He said he would meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ‚ÄùHe‚Äôs running his country, and at least he‚Äôs a leader, unlike what we have in this country,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ‚Äùtalented.‚Äù Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ‚ÄùI never met Putin. I don‚Äôt know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I‚Äôm a genius. I said, ‚ÄôThank you very much‚Äô to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,‚Äù Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn‚Äôt going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ‚Äùa leader far more than our president has been‚Äù at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump‚Äôs debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ‚Äùpuppet‚Äù of Russia. Trump shot back: ‚ÄùNo puppet. No puppet. You‚Äôre the puppet.‚Äù He often criticizes the   ‚Äùreset‚Äù with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy  ‚Äî   violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump‚Äôs staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won‚Äôt end once he‚Äôs in the Oval Office. So far, he‚Äôs outlined his opposition to the United States‚Äô abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he‚Äôs often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia  ‚Äî   perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama‚Äôs.\n",

      "Updated at 2:50 p. m. ET, Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia won‚Äôt be expelling U. S. diplomats in a    response to U. S. sanctions, as his foreign minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of   Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Trump took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to praise Putin‚Äôs decision, calling it a ‚Äùgreat move.‚Äù On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it called ‚Äùa   campaign of   operations‚Äù against the U. S.  ‚Äî   including actions meant to interfere with the U. S. presidential election. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went on state TV and called the sanctions ‚Äùantics‚Äù that Russia can‚Äôt leave unanswered. He said the U. S. provided no evidence for its claims of Russian cyber operations, NPR‚Äôs Lucian Kim reports. ‚ÄùThe Kremlin has consistently denied accusations that its hackers had broken into the Democratic National Committee or tried to sway the U. S. election,‚Äù Lucian notes. And he proposed specific counteractions Russia could take. As we reported Thursday, President Obama‚Äôs executive order calls for 35 Russian diplomats  ‚Äî   described by the White House as ‚Äùintelligence operatives‚Äù  ‚Äî   to be expelled from the U. S. and for two Russian facilities in the U. S. to be closed. Sanctions will also be imposed on several Russian individuals and organizations, and Obama‚Äôs statement says more actions will be taken, ‚Äùsome of which will not be publicized.‚Äù Lavrov announced plans for Russia to respond in kind, as Lucian reported from Moscow. Lavrov‚Äôs plan, which needed Putin‚Äôs approval, called for 35 American diplomats to be expelled and for U. S. diplomats to ‚Äùlose access to two buildings, just as Russian diplomats will no longer be able to use two retreats in Maryland and New York,‚Äù Lucian reports. But just two hours after Lavrov‚Äôs comments, Putin announced that nothing of the sort was happening. Putin called the Obama administration‚Äôs actions provocative and said Russia had grounds for a response. He said the Kremlin would reserve the right to a countermeasure  ‚Äî   but that it would not ‚Äùstoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy,‚Äù as Lucian translated it. At least for now, no diplomats will be expelled or barred from using facilities in Moscow, he said. Any actions will wait until Trump takes office. ‚ÄùIt is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,‚Äù Putin said. ‚ÄùNevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. ‚ÄùMy season‚Äôs greetings also to   Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.‚Äù\n",

      "In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù but also ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù and ‚Äùa prime example of this administration‚Äôs ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.‚Äù Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ‚Äù[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia‚Äôs worldwide aggression, including its   operations,‚Äù wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ‚ÄùNow with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.‚Äù Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ‚Äùmuch tougher‚Äù actions and said three times that Obama had ‚Äùfinally found his tongue.‚Äù Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama‚Äôs real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ‚Äùtie Trump‚Äôs hands‚Äù or ‚Äùbox him in,‚Äù meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country‚Äôs embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad‚Äôs forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ‚Äùfind‚Äù missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  ‚Äî   Putin‚Äôs longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump‚Äôs extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  ‚Äî   the idea that they helped Trump win  ‚Äî   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump‚Äôs legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies‚Äô concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ‚Äùno one really knows what happened.‚Äù He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ‚Äùget on with our lives and do more important things.‚Äù However, at week‚Äôs end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  ‚Äî   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia‚Äôs hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister‚Äôs recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ‚Äùthe bigger man,‚Äù even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ‚ÄùGreat move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!‚Äù At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.\n",

      "  Donald Trump has used Twitter  ‚Äî   his preferred means of communication  ‚Äî   to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters  ‚Äî   but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won‚Äôt end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.‚Äôs abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the   solution in the region. Trump‚Äôs support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  ‚Äî   who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama  ‚Äî   may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump‚Äôs morning tweets, thanking him  ‚Äî   and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers  ‚Äî   for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ‚Äùdetailed, sensitive information‚Äù proving that the U. S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U. S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ‚Äùthings will be different‚Äù come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U. N. as ineffective. The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe reported that the   told them he wanted an ‚Äùarms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.‚Äù As the Washington Post‚Äôs Dan Zak told NPR‚Äôs Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ‚ÄùTrump said, you know, he‚Äôd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they‚Äôre capable of doing,‚Äù Zak said. ‚ÄùAt the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy.‚Äù Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ‚Äùunpresidented‚Äù in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. It‚Äôs not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn‚Äôt recognize it, and most other countries don‚Äôt either. The U. S. has operated under a ‚Äùone China‚Äù policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U. S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U. S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka‚Äôs clothing and shoe lines are made in China much of Trump‚Äôs own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China.\n",

      "  Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin‚Äôs decision not to expel U. S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country  ‚Äî   admiring the Russian leader‚Äôs strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump‚Äôs ongoing praise of Putin. Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise  ‚Äî   a stark break from decades of U. S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U. S. also retweeted Trump‚Äôs post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U. S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said ‚Äùall Americans should be alarmed by Russia‚Äôs actions.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama‚Äôs actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù but ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù and said that ‚ÄùRussia does not share America‚Äôs interests.‚Äù ‚ÄùThe Russians are not our friends,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ‚Äùgood initial step.‚Äù Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U. S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia‚Äôs economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.‚Äù He said he would meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ‚ÄùHe‚Äôs running his country, and at least he‚Äôs a leader, unlike what we have in this country,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ‚Äùtalented.‚Äù Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ‚ÄùI never met Putin. I don‚Äôt know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I‚Äôm a genius. I said, ‚ÄôThank you very much‚Äô to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,‚Äù Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn‚Äôt going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ‚Äùa leader far more than our president has been‚Äù at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump‚Äôs debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ‚Äùpuppet‚Äù of Russia. Trump shot back: ‚ÄùNo puppet. No puppet. You‚Äôre the puppet.‚Äù He often criticizes the   ‚Äùreset‚Äù with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy  ‚Äî   violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump‚Äôs staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won‚Äôt end once he‚Äôs in the Oval Office. So far, he‚Äôs outlined his opposition to the United States‚Äô abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he‚Äôs often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia  ‚Äî   perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama‚Äôs.\n",

      "Updated at 2:50 p. m. ET, Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia won‚Äôt be expelling U. S. diplomats in a    response to U. S. sanctions, as his foreign minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of   Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Trump took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to praise Putin‚Äôs decision, calling it a ‚Äùgreat move.‚Äù On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it called ‚Äùa   campaign of   operations‚Äù against the U. S.  ‚Äî   including actions meant to interfere with the U. S. presidential election. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went on state TV and called the sanctions ‚Äùantics‚Äù that Russia can‚Äôt leave unanswered. He said the U. S. provided no evidence for its claims of Russian cyber operations, NPR‚Äôs Lucian Kim reports. ‚ÄùThe Kremlin has consistently denied accusations that its hackers had broken into the Democratic National Committee or tried to sway the U. S. election,‚Äù Lucian notes. And he proposed specific counteractions Russia could take. As we reported Thursday, President Obama‚Äôs executive order calls for 35 Russian diplomats  ‚Äî   described by the White House as ‚Äùintelligence operatives‚Äù  ‚Äî   to be expelled from the U. S. and for two Russian facilities in the U. S. to be closed. Sanctions will also be imposed on several Russian individuals and organizations, and Obama‚Äôs statement says more actions will be taken, ‚Äùsome of which will not be publicized.‚Äù Lavrov announced plans for Russia to respond in kind, as Lucian reported from Moscow. Lavrov‚Äôs plan, which needed Putin‚Äôs approval, called for 35 American diplomats to be expelled and for U. S. diplomats to ‚Äùlose access to two buildings, just as Russian diplomats will no longer be able to use two retreats in Maryland and New York,‚Äù Lucian reports. But just two hours after Lavrov‚Äôs comments, Putin announced that nothing of the sort was happening. Putin called the Obama administration‚Äôs actions provocative and said Russia had grounds for a response. He said the Kremlin would reserve the right to a countermeasure  ‚Äî   but that it would not ‚Äùstoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy,‚Äù as Lucian translated it. At least for now, no diplomats will be expelled or barred from using facilities in Moscow, he said. Any actions will wait until Trump takes office. ‚ÄùIt is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,‚Äù Putin said. ‚ÄùNevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. ‚ÄùMy season‚Äôs greetings also to   Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.‚Äù\n",

      "In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù but also ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù and ‚Äùa prime example of this administration‚Äôs ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.‚Äù Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ‚Äù[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia‚Äôs worldwide aggression, including its   operations,‚Äù wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ‚ÄùNow with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.‚Äù Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ‚Äùmuch tougher‚Äù actions and said three times that Obama had ‚Äùfinally found his tongue.‚Äù Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama‚Äôs real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ‚Äùtie Trump‚Äôs hands‚Äù or ‚Äùbox him in,‚Äù meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country‚Äôs embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad‚Äôs forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ‚Äùfind‚Äù missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  ‚Äî   Putin‚Äôs longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump‚Äôs extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  ‚Äî   the idea that they helped Trump win  ‚Äî   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump‚Äôs legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies‚Äô concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ‚Äùno one really knows what happened.‚Äù He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ‚Äùget on with our lives and do more important things.‚Äù However, at week‚Äôs end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  ‚Äî   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia‚Äôs hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister‚Äôs recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ‚Äùthe bigger man,‚Äù even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ‚ÄùGreat move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!‚Äù At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.\n",

      "  Donald Trump has used Twitter  ‚Äî   his preferred means of communication  ‚Äî   to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters  ‚Äî   but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won‚Äôt end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.‚Äôs abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the   solution in the region. Trump‚Äôs support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  ‚Äî   who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama  ‚Äî   may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump‚Äôs morning tweets, thanking him  ‚Äî   and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers  ‚Äî   for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ‚Äùdetailed, sensitive information‚Äù proving that the U. S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U. S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ‚Äùthings will be different‚Äù come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U. N. as ineffective. The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe reported that the   told them he wanted an ‚Äùarms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.‚Äù As the Washington Post‚Äôs Dan Zak told NPR‚Äôs Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ‚ÄùTrump said, you know, he‚Äôd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they‚Äôre capable of doing,‚Äù Zak said. ‚ÄùAt the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy.‚Äù Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ‚Äùunpresidented‚Äù in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. It‚Äôs not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn‚Äôt recognize it, and most other countries don‚Äôt either. The U. S. has operated under a ‚Äùone China‚Äù policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U. S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U. S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka‚Äôs clothing and shoe lines are made in China much of Trump‚Äôs own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China.\n",

      "  Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin‚Äôs decision not to expel U. S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country  ‚Äî   admiring the Russian leader‚Äôs strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump‚Äôs ongoing praise of Putin. Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise  ‚Äî   a stark break from decades of U. S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U. S. also retweeted Trump‚Äôs post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U. S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said ‚Äùall Americans should be alarmed by Russia‚Äôs actions.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama‚Äôs actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù but ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù and said that ‚ÄùRussia does not share America‚Äôs interests.‚Äù ‚ÄùThe Russians are not our friends,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ‚Äùgood initial step.‚Äù Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U. S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia‚Äôs economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.‚Äù He said he would meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ‚ÄùHe‚Äôs running his country, and at least he‚Äôs a leader, unlike what we have in this country,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ‚Äùtalented.‚Äù Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ‚ÄùI never met Putin. I don‚Äôt know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I‚Äôm a genius. I said, ‚ÄôThank you very much‚Äô to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,‚Äù Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn‚Äôt going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ‚Äùa leader far more than our president has been‚Äù at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump‚Äôs debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ‚Äùpuppet‚Äù of Russia. Trump shot back: ‚ÄùNo puppet. No puppet. You‚Äôre the puppet.‚Äù He often criticizes the   ‚Äùreset‚Äù with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy  ‚Äî   violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump‚Äôs staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won‚Äôt end once he‚Äôs in the Oval Office. So far, he‚Äôs outlined his opposition to the United States‚Äô abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he‚Äôs often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia  ‚Äî   perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama‚Äôs.\n",

      "Updated at 2:50 p. m. ET, Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia won‚Äôt be expelling U. S. diplomats in a    response to U. S. sanctions, as his foreign minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of   Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Trump took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to praise Putin‚Äôs decision, calling it a ‚Äùgreat move.‚Äù On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it called ‚Äùa   campaign of   operations‚Äù against the U. S.  ‚Äî   including actions meant to interfere with the U. S. presidential election. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went on state TV and called the sanctions ‚Äùantics‚Äù that Russia can‚Äôt leave unanswered. He said the U. S. provided no evidence for its claims of Russian cyber operations, NPR‚Äôs Lucian Kim reports. ‚ÄùThe Kremlin has consistently denied accusations that its hackers had broken into the Democratic National Committee or tried to sway the U. S. election,‚Äù Lucian notes. And he proposed specific counteractions Russia could take. As we reported Thursday, President Obama‚Äôs executive order calls for 35 Russian diplomats  ‚Äî   described by the White House as ‚Äùintelligence operatives‚Äù  ‚Äî   to be expelled from the U. S. and for two Russian facilities in the U. S. to be closed. Sanctions will also be imposed on several Russian individuals and organizations, and Obama‚Äôs statement says more actions will be taken, ‚Äùsome of which will not be publicized.‚Äù Lavrov announced plans for Russia to respond in kind, as Lucian reported from Moscow. Lavrov‚Äôs plan, which needed Putin‚Äôs approval, called for 35 American diplomats to be expelled and for U. S. diplomats to ‚Äùlose access to two buildings, just as Russian diplomats will no longer be able to use two retreats in Maryland and New York,‚Äù Lucian reports. But just two hours after Lavrov‚Äôs comments, Putin announced that nothing of the sort was happening. Putin called the Obama administration‚Äôs actions provocative and said Russia had grounds for a response. He said the Kremlin would reserve the right to a countermeasure  ‚Äî   but that it would not ‚Äùstoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy,‚Äù as Lucian translated it. At least for now, no diplomats will be expelled or barred from using facilities in Moscow, he said. Any actions will wait until Trump takes office. ‚ÄùIt is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,‚Äù Putin said. ‚ÄùNevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. ‚ÄùMy season‚Äôs greetings also to   Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.‚Äù\n",

      "In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù but also ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù and ‚Äùa prime example of this administration‚Äôs ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.‚Äù Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ‚Äù[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia‚Äôs worldwide aggression, including its   operations,‚Äù wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ‚ÄùNow with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.‚Äù Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ‚Äùmuch tougher‚Äù actions and said three times that Obama had ‚Äùfinally found his tongue.‚Äù Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama‚Äôs real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ‚Äùtie Trump‚Äôs hands‚Äù or ‚Äùbox him in,‚Äù meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country‚Äôs embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad‚Äôs forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ‚Äùfind‚Äù missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  ‚Äî   Putin‚Äôs longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump‚Äôs extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  ‚Äî   the idea that they helped Trump win  ‚Äî   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump‚Äôs legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies‚Äô concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ‚Äùno one really knows what happened.‚Äù He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ‚Äùget on with our lives and do more important things.‚Äù However, at week‚Äôs end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  ‚Äî   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia‚Äôs hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister‚Äôs recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ‚Äùthe bigger man,‚Äù even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ‚ÄùGreat move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!‚Äù At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.\n",

      "  Donald Trump has used Twitter  ‚Äî   his preferred means of communication  ‚Äî   to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters  ‚Äî   but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won‚Äôt end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.‚Äôs abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the   solution in the region. Trump‚Äôs support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  ‚Äî   who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama  ‚Äî   may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump‚Äôs morning tweets, thanking him  ‚Äî   and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers  ‚Äî   for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ‚Äùdetailed, sensitive information‚Äù proving that the U. S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U. S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ‚Äùthings will be different‚Äù come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U. N. as ineffective. The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe reported that the   told them he wanted an ‚Äùarms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.‚Äù As the Washington Post‚Äôs Dan Zak told NPR‚Äôs Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ‚ÄùTrump said, you know, he‚Äôd be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they‚Äôre capable of doing,‚Äù Zak said. ‚ÄùAt the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy.‚Äù Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ‚Äùunpresidented‚Äù in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. It‚Äôs not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn‚Äôt recognize it, and most other countries don‚Äôt either. The U. S. has operated under a ‚Äùone China‚Äù policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U. S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U. S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka‚Äôs clothing and shoe lines are made in China much of Trump‚Äôs own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China.\n",

      "  Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin‚Äôs decision not to expel U. S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country  ‚Äî   admiring the Russian leader‚Äôs strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump‚Äôs ongoing praise of Putin. Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise  ‚Äî   a stark break from decades of U. S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U. S. also retweeted Trump‚Äôs post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U. S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said ‚Äùall Americans should be alarmed by Russia‚Äôs actions.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama‚Äôs actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ‚Äùoverdue‚Äù but ‚Äùappropriate‚Äù and said that ‚ÄùRussia does not share America‚Äôs interests.‚Äù ‚ÄùThe Russians are not our friends,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ‚Äùgood initial step.‚Äù Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U. S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia‚Äôs economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.‚Äù He said he would meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ‚ÄùHe‚Äôs running his country, and at least he‚Äôs a leader, unlike what we have in this country,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ‚Äùtalented.‚Äù Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ‚ÄùI never met Putin. I don‚Äôt know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I‚Äôm a genius. I said, ‚ÄôThank you very much‚Äô to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,‚Äù Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn‚Äôt going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ‚Äùa leader far more than our president has been‚Äù at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump‚Äôs debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ‚Äùpuppet‚Äù of Russia. Trump shot back: ‚ÄùNo puppet. No puppet. You‚Äôre the puppet.‚Äù He often criticizes the   ‚Äùreset‚Äù with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy  ‚Äî   violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump‚Äôs staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won‚Äôt end once he‚Äôs in the Oval Office. So far, he‚Äôs outlined his opposition to the United States‚Äô abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he‚Äôs often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia  ‚Äî   perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama‚Äôs.\n",

      "Updated at 2:50 p. m. ET, Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia won‚Äôt be expelling U. S. diplomats in a    response to U. S. sanctions, as his foreign minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of   Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Trump took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to praise Putin‚Äôs decision, calling it a ‚Äùgreat move.‚Äù On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it called ‚Äùa   campaign of   operations‚Äù against the U. S.  ‚Äî   including actions meant to interfere with the U. S. presidential election. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went on state TV and called the sanctions ‚Äùantics‚Äù that Russia can‚Äôt leave unanswered. He said the U. S. provided no evidence for its claims of Russian cyber operations, NPR‚Äôs Lucian Kim reports. ‚ÄùThe Kremlin has consistently denied accusations that its hackers had broken into the Democratic National Committee or tried to sway the U. S. election,‚Äù Lucian notes. And he proposed specific counteractions Russia could take. As we reported Thursday, President Obama‚Äôs executive order calls for 35 Russian diplomats  ‚Äî   described by the White House as ‚Äùintelligence operatives‚Äù  ‚Äî   to be expelled from the U. S. and for two Russian facilities in the U. S. to be closed. Sanctions will also be imposed on several Russian individuals and organizations, and Obama‚Äôs statement says more actions will be taken, ‚Äùsome of which will not be publicized.‚Äù Lavrov announced plans for Russia to respond in kind, as Lucian reported from Moscow. Lavrov‚Äôs plan, which needed Putin‚Äôs approval, called for 35 American diplomats to be expelled and for U. S. diplomats to ‚Äùlose access to two buildings, just as Russian diplomats will no longer be able to use two retreats in Maryland and New York,‚Äù Lucian reports. But just two hours after Lavrov‚Äôs comments, Putin announced that nothing of the sort was happening. Putin called the Obama administration‚Äôs actions provocative and said Russia had grounds for a response. He said the Kremlin would reserve the right to a countermeasure  ‚Äî   but that it would not ‚Äùstoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy,‚Äù as Lucian translated it. At least for now, no diplomats will be expelled or barred from using facilities in Moscow, he said. Any actions will wait until Trump takes office. ‚ÄùIt is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,‚Äù Putin said. ‚ÄùNevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. ‚ÄùMy season‚Äôs greetings also to   Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.‚Äù\n",
